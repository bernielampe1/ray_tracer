* Project 3 Write-Up

1) Files Modified and included in submission
    p3/cylinder.h, p3/light.h, p3/loadscene.cpp, p3/mesh.h, p3/raytracer.cpp,
    p3/xform.h

2) Platform
 - This project was developed, compiled and tested on a linux platform and the
caen-vnc04 server.  It was built using the enclosed Makefile and GNU make 3.81.

3) Project Notes
 - There was no indication on what proportion of light was to be reflected
   and retransmitted from a specular surface.  Instead of Fresnel coefficients,
   I used the constant 0.8.  It is defined in the raytracer.cpp.

 - The cylinder intersection routine was adapted from the BallT::interesect
   routine.  First, the intersection with the infinite conic section is
   computed and then the special case is checked.  The special case is when
   the ray is parallel to the z-axis.  This case needs to be checked first
   because it results in a division by zero when solving the quadratic.
   Finally the ray is clipped to the planes on the end caps and the normal
   at the point of intersection is computed.

 - The anti-aliasing samples were generated by jittering the regular samples
   across the pixel as specified in the FCG2 excerpt.

 - The area light implementation was the simple version mentioned in the
   FCG2 excerpt where the light location is a random location in the
   light parallelogram.

 - My first attempt at an original scene was to do an indoor still life,
   but found that extrodinarily hard because I didn't have texture maps
   and finding free models on the open internet was difficult.

   The custom.sce file contains my custom scene.  The scene was composed
   of 6 tinted mirrors configured in a box.  The mirrors reflect each other
   in a recursive, nested scene.  This gives the impression of a large
   lattice structure.  The viewer is in the box looking at the back panel.
   The mirrors are framed with cylinders tinted purple.  The front and back
   panels are tinted blue, the left and right are tinted green and the top
   and bottom are tinted red.  I added scaled spheres to the scene which
   were recursively reflected given the impression of many more spheres.
   The scene gives the impression of reflective bubbles traversing
   the enclosure.  I call the scene "neon aquarium".

4) Feedback
 - I found that the information in the "Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 2nd
   ed." excerts was very general and uninformative.  Having a single, coherent
   source for this project would have helped my understanding.

 - The cylinder intersection routine was challenging, but a good, non-trivial
   introduction.

 - The starter code wasn't commented very well and the style wasn't consistent.
